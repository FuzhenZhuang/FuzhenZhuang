        <p>Person-Organization fit (P-O fit) refers to the compatibility between employees and their organizations. The study of P-O fit is important for enhancing  proactive talent management.While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, it still lacks a quantitative and holistic way for measuring P-O fit and its impact on talent management. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel data-driven neural network approach for dynamically modeling the compatibility in P-O fit and its meaningful relationships with two critical issues in talent management, namely talent turnover and job performance. <br/><br/> Specifically, inspired by the practical management scenarios, we first creatively design an Organizational Structure-aware Convolutional Neural Network (OSCN)  for hierarchically extracting organization-aware compatibility features for measuring P-O fit. Then, to capture the dynamic nature of P-O fit and its consequent impact, we further exploit an adapted Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanism to model the temporal information of P-O fit. <br /><br /> We evaluate our approach with a number of state-of-the-art baseline methods on real-world talent data. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of turnover prediction and job performance prediction, as well as some interesting indicators of talent management through the visualization of network layers. Moreover, our study reveals some management insights for enhancing proactive talent management. For instance, the results show that superiors usually have a great influence on the turnover intention of their subordinates.<br/><br/></p>

Urban Region-of-Interest (ROI) refers to the integrated urban areas with specific functionalities that attract people's attentions and activities, such as the recreational business districts, transportation hubs, and city landmarks. Indeed, at the macro level, ROI is one of the representatives for agglomeration economies, and plays an important role in urban business planning. At the micro level, ROI provides a useful venue for understanding the urban lives, demands and mobilities of people. However, due to the vague and diversified nature of ROI, it still lacks of quantitative ways to investigate ROIs in a holistic manner. <br/><br/>
To this end, in this paper we propose a systematic study on ROI analysis through mining the large-scale online map query logs, which provides a new data-driven research paradigm for ROI detection and profiling. Specifically, we first divide the urban area into small region grids, and calculate their PageRank value as visiting popularity based on the transition information extracted from map queries. Then, we propose a density-based clustering method for merging neighboring region grids with high popularity into integrated ROIs. After that, to further explore the profiles of different ROIs, we develop a spatial-temporal latent factor model URPTM (Urban Roi Profiling Topic Model) to identify the latent travel patterns and Point-of-Interest (POI) demands of ROI visitors. <br/><br/>
We implement extensive experiments to empirically evaluate our approaches based on the large-scale real-world data collected from Beijing. Indeed, by visualizing the results obtained from URPTM, we can successfully obtain many meaningful travel patterns and interesting discoveries on urban lives.</p>
